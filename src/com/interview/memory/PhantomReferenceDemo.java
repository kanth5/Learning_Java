// Phantom references are most often used for scheduling pre-mortem cleanup actions in a more flexible way than is possible with
// the Java finalization mechanism. Unlike soft and weak references, phantom references are not automatically cleared by the
// garbage collector as they are enqueued. An object that is reachable via phantom references will remain so until all such
// references are cleared or themselves become unreachable.

// Before Java 9
// Whilst Weak and Soft references are put in the queue after the object is finalized, Phantom references are put in the queue
// before the object is finalized. If for any reason you donâ€™t poll the queue, the actual objects referenced by the
// PhantomReference will not be finalized, and you can incur an OutOfMemory error. Consider the same program from the previous
// question where instead of a weak reference we'll use a phantom reference.

// Java 9 and After
// Another difference between Phantom references and other references is that the get() method of a phantom reference always
// returns null even before a GC has occurred. The other reference types return their referents with the get() method.Phantom
// reference can be used to notify one when an object is out of scope to do resource cleanup. Remember that the object.finalize()
// method is not guaranteed to be called at the end of the life of an object, so if one needs to close files or free resources,
// one can rely on Phantom references. A typical pattern is to derive your own reference type from PhantomReference and add
// information useful for the final freeing.
